This is a hands-on workhop. Me and Jon will talk about some stuff, and then we will let you try things out.

## Installing R and R Studio
Instructions courtesy of Data carpentries, see [here](https://mq-software-carpentry.github.io/r-ggplot-extension/setup.html) for full instruction and linux install.

### Windows

**If you already have R and RStudio installed:**
Open RStudio, and click on “Help” > “Check for updates”. If a new version is available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio. To check which version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing that appears in the console indicates the version of R you are running. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()`, which will also display which version of R you are running. Go on the CRAN website and check whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install it. You can check here for more information on how to remove old versions from your system if you wish to do so.

**If you don’t have R and RStudio installed:**
Download R from the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).
Run the `.exe` file that was just downloaded
Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
Under Installers select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows Vista/7/8/10** (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
Double click the file to install it
Once it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.
